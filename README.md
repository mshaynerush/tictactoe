# tictactoe
A javascript based game of tic tac toe
Stemming from a college project in C++ where in a tic tac toe game was made, this is basically the same idea in javascript.
the player should only be able to draw or lose
the play should randomly choose the player or the computer to move first
the result of the game is displayed at the end
you can play again when the game is over
